{"name":"Roads-package","tagline":"A set of helper functions to take advantage of US Roadways data--including the shapes for major roads.","body":"# Roads package in R Programming Language\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a helper package to deal with data on major interstates, highways, and state roads. When I was dealing with this data I noticed that it was a bit finicky and that no one had posted work or code so I thought I'd just make it easier and release some functions that I found helpful. \r\n\r\nThe data that is being used can be downloaded from the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty   <https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/tools/nhpn/> . The metadata is available at <https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/tools/nhpn/2015/nhpnmetadata.txt> and I strongly suggest looking through it before you integrate this data to make sure you're getting what you actually want.\r\n\r\nThis package is still **in development**, but should be available by the end of the March 2016 (at the latest). If you have any questions don't hesitate to send me an email at SathishCDeevi*at*gmail*dot*com. I hope you find this useful!\r\n\r\n-Sathish Deevi\r\n\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
