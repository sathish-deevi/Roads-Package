<p>This is a helper package to deal with data on major interstates, highways, and state roads. When I was dealing with this data I noticed that it was a bit finicky and that no one had posted work or code so I thought I'd just make it easier and release some functions that I found helpful. </p>

<p>The data that is being used can be downloaded from the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty   <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/tools/nhpn/">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/tools/nhpn/</a> . The metadata is available at <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/tools/nhpn/2015/nhpnmetadata.txt">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/tools/nhpn/2015/nhpnmetadata.txt</a> and I strongly suggest looking through it before you integrate this data to make sure you're getting what you actually want.</p>

<p>This package is still <strong>in development</strong>, but should be available by the end of the March 2016 (at the latest). If you have any questions don't hesitate to send me an email at SathishCDeevi<em>at</em>gmail<em>dot</em>com. I hope you find this useful!</p>
